# Pi2goForPython3

Based on stuff from https://4tronix.co.uk/blog/?cat=4
which is developed for python2
This repo is for the transition of this material to python3 so that the pi2go can be used with python3 on the rpi4

Using with ScratchGPIO

Simplesi (Simon Walters) has generously included Pi2Go Mk2 in the list of directly supported devices in ScratchGPIO.

Visit this blog post for installation and coding tips
Installing the Pi2Go Mk2 Python Software

First you will need to prepare your Pi for the Smart RGB LEDs (fully compatible with neopixels). The best way we’ve found to do this is run Pimoroni’s curl script.
With your Pi connected to the internet, run (you don’t need to install the resources and examples):

curl -sS https://get.pimoroni.com/unicornhat | bash

Download the Python3 library module and example software for Pi2Go Mk2 here.

( based on https://4tronix.co.uk/pi2go2.sh )

original python2 files have the extension .bak

For posterity: I had the same problem and fixed it using,

sed -i 's/\x0//g' FILENAME (rpi_ws281x)
